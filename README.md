# Sonia Guzman Habegger

<!--Welcome! This repository contains the complete template for a professional, one-page data analysis portfolio website, hosted for free on GitHub Pages. -->

## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a Food Scientist by education, and through product development projects, I started to become more interested into the opportunity behind this developments. I got interested in consumer insights and finding where the market opportunity lied. This organic transition propulsed me into business intelligence / data analysis. I am passionate about helping businesses make sense of their data. I enjoy transforming complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights.

My focus is on building BI reports that get used, automating repetitive tasks to free up teams for more interesting problems, and creating models that help businesses plan for the future.


When I'm not working with data, I enjoy scrapbooking, preparing trips with storyboarding, and listening to music.
